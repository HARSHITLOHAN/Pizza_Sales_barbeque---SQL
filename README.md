# 🍕 Barbeuq Pizza Sales Data Analysis Project

Hey there! 👋  
This is my complete **SQL Data Analysis Portfolio Project** where I explored pizza sales data from a fictional pizza restaurant called **Barbeuq**. The goal was to derive meaningful business insights using SQL.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project helped me practice and showcase my SQL skills across **basic, intermediate, and advanced query levels**. I focused on analyzing customer behavior, sales performance, and pizza preferences.

I worked through a series of structured queries to answer important business questions like:
- Which pizzas are most popular?
- How much revenue does each type generate?
- What time of day are most orders placed?

---

## 🧠 Skills Used
- SQL Joins
- Grouping and Aggregation
- CTEs and Subqueries
- Window Functions
- Date & Time Functions
- Data Cleaning (if needed)

---

## 🗃️ Dataset Info

The data is split across several tables including:
- `orders`
- `order_details`
- `pizzas`
- `pizza_types`

Each table plays a role in joining and extracting complete info from raw order transactions.

## 🧾 SQL Queries Breakdown

### 🔹 Basic Level Queries:
- ✅ Total number of orders placed
- ✅ Total revenue generated from pizza sales
- ✅ Highest-priced pizza
- ✅ Most commonly ordered pizza size
- ✅ Top 5 most ordered pizza types with quantities

### 🔸 Intermediate Level Queries:
- ✅ Quantity of each **pizza category** ordered (using joins)
- ✅ Distribution of orders by **hour of the day**
- ✅ Category-wise pizza distribution
- ✅ Average number of pizzas ordered **per day**
- ✅ Top 3 most ordered pizzas based on **revenue**

### 🔺 Advanced Level Queries:
- ✅ Percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue
- ✅ **Cumulative revenue** over time
- ✅ Top 3 revenue-generating pizzas for **each pizza category**

---

## 📈 Insights Gained

Some of the insights I found interesting:
- Certain pizza types dominate revenue, not just in quantity but also in price.
- Orders spike during specific hours — great for targeting offers.
- Large-size pizzas are ordered more frequently than others.
- Some categories like *Classic* and *Veggie* consistently outperform others.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- SQL (SQLite)
- DB Browser for SQLite (for testing)
- Git & GitHub (for version control and portfolio)

---

## 📁 How to Use

If you want to try the queries yourself:

1. Clone this repo
2. Open the `.db` file in DB Browser for SQLite (or your SQL tool of choice)
3. Open the `.sql` files and run the queries
4. You can tweak or extend them based on what you want to analyze!

## 🎯 Future Improvements

Some things I’d like to do next:
- Visualize the data in Power BI or Tableau
- Automate some analysis with Python
- Create a dashboard for non-technical users

## 🙋‍♂️ Why I Built This

I’m learning data analysis and wanted to create something real that covers all aspects: **raw data → structured queries → business insights**. This project is a part of my growing portfolio to demonstrate my SQL and data thinking skills.
